Hi every body. I'm Vu Van Ly, fullstack developer. I started work as a developer when i'm senior. Now i'm working with Ruby on Rails in backend and AngularJS in frontend.
I'm also interested in Mobile, especially in Android and Mobile.
I want to improve myself everyday, mostly in programming, skills and languages now. Currently, I learn Hebrew.
I love travelling around the World to make friends with many people the this earth.
